# A Course on Surreal Numbers

Some notes: We can create a file `n-topic-name.typ` for each slot in the course. I am just realizing that is is very random, that I am writing all this in english even though the course will be in german -- anyways.

Don't worry about the `flake.nix` and the `.envrc`. They are just a quality of life improvement for me. All you really need is a `typst 14.<something>` installation. All sections should compile independendly of the `main.typ`.
